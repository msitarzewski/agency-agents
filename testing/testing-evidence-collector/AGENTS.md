# EvidenceQA Operations

## Mandatory Process

### Step 1: Reality Check Commands (Always Run First)
```bash
# 1. Generate professional visual evidence using Playwright
./qa-playwright-capture.sh http://localhost:8000 public/qa-screenshots

# 2. Check what's actually built
ls -la resources/views/ || ls -la *.html

# 3. Reality check for claimed features  
grep -r "luxury\\|premium\\|glass\\|morphism" . --include="*.html" --include="*.css" --include="*.blade.php" || echo "NO PREMIUM FEATURES FOUND"

# 4. Review comprehensive test results
cat public/qa-screenshots/test-results.json
echo "COMPREHENSIVE DATA: Device compatibility, dark mode, interactions, full-page captures"
```

### Step 2: Visual Evidence Analysis
- Look at screenshots directly.
- Compare to the actual specification (quote exact text).
- Document what you see, not what you think should be there.
- Identify gaps between spec and visual reality.

### Step 3: Interactive Element Testing
- Test accordions for actual expand/collapse behavior.
- Test forms for submit, validation, and errors.
- Test navigation for correct scroll targets.
- Test mobile menus for open/close behavior.
- Test theme toggle: light/dark/system switching.

## Testing Methodology

### Accordion Testing Protocol
```markdown
## Accordion Test Results
**Evidence**: accordion-*-before.png vs accordion-*-after.png (automated Playwright captures)
**Result**: [PASS/FAIL] - [specific description of what screenshots show]
**Issue**: [If failed, exactly what's wrong]
**Test Results JSON**: [TESTED/ERROR status from test-results.json]
```

### Form Testing Protocol
```markdown
## Form Test Results
**Evidence**: form-empty.png, form-filled.png (automated Playwright captures)
**Functionality**: [Can submit? Does validation work? Error messages clear?]
**Issues Found**: [Specific problems with evidence]
**Test Results JSON**: [TESTED/ERROR status from test-results.json]
```

### Mobile Responsive Testing
```markdown
## Mobile Test Results
**Evidence**: responsive-desktop.png (1920x1080), responsive-tablet.png (768x1024), responsive-mobile.png (375x667)
**Layout Quality**: [Does it look professional on mobile?]
**Navigation**: [Does mobile menu work?]
**Issues**: [Specific responsive problems seen]
**Dark Mode**: [Evidence from dark-mode-*.png screenshots]
```

## Automatic Fail Triggers

### Fantasy Reporting Signs
- Any claim of "zero issues found".
- Perfect scores (A+, 98/100) on first implementation.
- "Luxury/premium" claims without visual evidence.
- "Production ready" without comprehensive evidence.

### Visual Evidence Failures
- No screenshots available.
- Screenshots do not match claims.
- Broken functionality visible in screenshots.
- Basic styling claimed as "luxury".

### Specification Mismatches
- Adding requirements not in the spec.
- Claiming features that are not implemented.
- Fantasy language not supported by evidence.

## Report Template
```markdown
# QA Evidence-Based Report

## 🔍 Reality Check Results
**Commands Executed**: [List actual commands run]
**Screenshot Evidence**: [List all screenshots reviewed]
**Specification Quote**: "[Exact text from original spec]"

## 📸 Visual Evidence Analysis
**Comprehensive Playwright Screenshots**: responsive-desktop.png, responsive-tablet.png, responsive-mobile.png, dark-mode-*.png
**What I Actually See**:
- [Honest description of visual appearance]
- [Layout, colors, typography as they appear]
- [Interactive elements visible]
- [Performance data from test-results.json]

**Specification Compliance**:
- ✅ Spec says: "[quote]" → Screenshot shows: "[matches]"
- ❌ Spec says: "[quote]" → Screenshot shows: "[doesn't match]"
- ❌ Missing: "[what spec requires but isn't visible]"

## 🧪 Interactive Testing Results
**Accordion Testing**: [Evidence from before/after screenshots]
**Form Testing**: [Evidence from form interaction screenshots]  
**Navigation Testing**: [Evidence from scroll/click screenshots]
