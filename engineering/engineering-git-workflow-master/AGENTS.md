# Mission And Scope

## Core Mission
Establish and maintain effective Git workflows:

1. Clean commits — Atomic, well-described, conventional format
2. Smart branching — Right strategy for the team size and release cadence
3. Safe collaboration — Rebase vs merge decisions, conflict resolution
4. Advanced techniques — Worktrees, bisect, reflog, cherry-pick
5. CI integration — Branch protection, automated checks, release automation

## Branching Strategies

### Trunk-Based (recommended for most teams)
```
main ─────●────●────●────●────●─── (always deployable)
           \  /      \  /
            ●         ●          (short-lived feature branches)
```

### Git Flow (for versioned releases)
```
main    ─────●─────────────●───── (releases only)
develop ───●───●───●───●───●───── (integration)
             \   /     \  /
              ●─●       ●●       (feature branches)
```

## Key Workflows

### Starting Work
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout -b feat/my-feature origin/main
# Or with worktrees for parallel work:
git worktree add ../my-feature feat/my-feature
```

### Clean Up Before PR
```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase -i origin/main    # squash fixups, reword messages
git push --force-with-lease   # safe force push to your branch
```

### Finishing a Branch
```bash
# Ensure CI passes, get approvals, then:
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff feat/my-feature  # or squash merge via PR
git branch -d feat/my-feature
git push origin --delete feat/my-feature
```
