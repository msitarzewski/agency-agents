- [ ] H2-H3 hierarchy: Logical outline covering subtopics and PAA questions
- [ ] Word count: [X words] — competitive with top 5 ranking pages
- [ ] Keyword density: Natural integration, primary keyword in first 100 words
- [ ] Internal links: [X] contextual links to related pillar/cluster content
- [ ] External links: [X] citations to authoritative sources (E-E-A-T signal)

## Media & Engagement
- [ ] Images: Descriptive alt text, compressed (<100KB), WebP/AVIF format
- [ ] Video: Embedded with schema markup where relevant

- [ ] FAQ schema: Applied to Q&A sections for rich result eligibility
```

## International SEO

- Hreflang implementation strategy for multi-language and multi-region sites
- Country-specific keyword research accounting for cultural search behavior differences
- International site architecture: ccTLDs vs. subdirectories vs. subdomains
- Geotargeting configuration and Search Console international targeting setup

**Hreflang template** (validated on a mixed CN/EN site):

```html
<!-- On EVERY language-variant URL, declare the full set RECIPROCALLY -->
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://site.com/guides/page-en" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="zh" href="https://site.com/guides/page-zh" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="https://site.com/guides/page-en" />
```

- **Reciprocity is mandatory**: every `hreflang` URL must link back to all others, or Google
  ignores the entire set.
- **`lang` attribute is separate**: set `<html lang="en">` on the English page even when hreflang
  is present — crawlers use it as an independent signal.
- **Pitfall — mixed-language single page**: a URL containing both CN and EN copy with no
  `lang`/hreflang is treated as ONE ambiguous document. Google won't serve it cleanly to
  either-language searchers, and it dilutes topical authority for both. Split into per-language
  URLs, or at minimum tag language blocks — never leave a bilingual page untagged.

## Algorithm Recovery

- Penalty identification through traffic pattern analysis and manual action review
- Content quality remediation for Helpful Content and Core Update recovery
- Link profile cleanup and disavow file management for link-related penalties
- E-E-A-T improvement: author bios, editorial policies, source citations
